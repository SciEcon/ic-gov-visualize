The proposal I had submitted two weeks ago was only a motion proposal, which passed, so now I am submitting the correct proposal for inclusion in the NNS known neuron list.

# About Me

For a long while I’ve been a contributor to various open source projects and communities, including Emacs, Haskell, Ledger, C++, Common Lisp, Rust and Coq. You could say I’m a technology enthusiast, always looking to learn about new ideas and how they connect to real systems.

I worked at DFINITY from 2018-2022, exiting as Principal Engineer after nearly 4 years. While there, I worked on the execution engine, integration testing, devops infrastructure, transitioning from Haskell to Rust, the NNS, tokenomics, and various other aspects of the system. I knew the full stack fairly well, and had moved to the research side of the organization about a year before I left. This allowed me to work alongside most teams in the organization at one point or another.

# Voting

The neuron I’m proposing to name is the first neuron I staked, just a few weeks after initial launch. For most proposals I follow ICP Maximalist, but this is not how I always vote. I have a strong interest in seeing the Internet Computer become more decentralized and friendly to both its stakeholders and the public interest — and this is how I intend to vote.

# Disclaimer

Although I plan to always vote, whether manually or by following, I do not commit to any particular platform. I will vote my conscience and hold to what I, personally, think will serve the interests of the network and its users best.
    Motivation: Remove FR2 nodes from the network in accordance with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/105                   # Replace a node in subnet eq6en.

Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [81618](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81618)  The ICP Maximalist Network was started with a core vision of promoting growth within the IC ecosystem. Many members of the ICPMN community contribute to that vision every day. A great example is the ICP Maximalist Network neuron, which has been a successful experiment demonstrating how people who care a lot about NNS governance can have a meaningful voice without owning large bags of ICP. The liquid democracy that currently results from our neuron vote has grown, which naturally surfaces unintended politics. It has become evident that the neuron needs to dissociate from the ICP Maximalist brand. The neuron exists to advance decentralization of the internet computer through leadership in governance participation. The ICP Maximalist Network is a brand that seeks growth in the web3 internet computer ecosystem. These are very different missions and we recognize that using the same name creates confusion in the IC community. Today we are excited to announce that the ICPMN neuron is spinning off as its own organization.

We propose that the ICP Maximalist Network neuron should be renamed to the **Synapse.Vote** neuron. A synapse is a site of communication between neurons in the nervous system, which seems like an appropriate metaphor. While the voting members and the general mission of the ICPMN neuron are not changing, this rebranding will establish it as a separate organization. All of the voting members of the neuron have collaborated on this transition and see it as a positive change for ICPMN and the IC as a whole.

Our manifesto and voting members are listed on our website [Synapse.vote](https://www.synapse.vote/). You are invited to follow the new Synapse neuron on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SynapseVote) and join the conversation on [Telegram](https://t.me/synapsevote).

## Manifesto

The Voting Members (listed below) of the Synapse neuron are committed to voting in the long term best interest of the Internet Computer. We are a balanced mix of well known IC enthusiasts, investors, developers, and DFINITY Foundation team members. We each bring our own priorities and biases to this neuron and we unapologetically vote on each proposal with our own convictions. Our diversity of thought and background is intended to provide a cross section of the IC ecosystem. Many of us routinely engage with the IC community in discussions about governance topics using a wide variety of social media platforms, but this is not a requirement to be a Voting Member. 

The Synapse neuron will be configured with up to 15 Followees for the Governance topic. It is currently configured to follow DFINITY for All Topics Except Governance topic, but we reserve the right to configure Followees for individual topics in the future when we determine that there are suitable experts in the ecosystem. A core principle of this neuron is that it can be trusted to always vote on all proposals. We actively monitor our participation in all Governance proposals to ensure the neuron votes. Anyone can monitor voting patterns of our neuron and individual voting members using the CrowdGov.org website.

## Voting Members

All voting members listed below are currently configured as Followees for the Governance Topic for the Synapse neuron. Visit our website for more information about each individual and our social media links.

## NNS Proposal Process

This Register Known Neuron proposal will be submitted from neuron ID [12008772471346176261](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/12008772471346176261), which belongs to Wenzel Bartlett and is used for the purpose of submitting NNS proposals. The mechanism for renaming a known neuron is to submit a new Register Known Neuron governance proposal to the NNS using the new name and the same neuron ID that is currently registered. This was first demonstrated when the cycle_dao neuron was renamed to Arthur’s neuron. We will complete our name transition to Synapse.vote in two phases. The first step will be to submit a proposal to rename the “ICP Maximalist Network” neuron to the “Synapse.vote (formerly ICP Maximalist Network)” neuron. Approx 3 months later we will submit another NNS proposal to rename again to the “Synapse.vote” neuron. The intermediate step will occur so it is obvious that the new name is the same neuron as the old name. We want to give all followers time to recognize that this transition is occurring so they are not surprised when they look at their Followee list and see that the name has changed.
